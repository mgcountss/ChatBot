# MGBot
### This is the same chatbot I use in my 24/7 <a href="https://youtube.com/@sfmg/live">live stream</a>!

## The setup guide below is outdated, I will update it soon though!
## How To Setup!
To run the program, make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> v18.15.0 or higher.
Next download the files and navigate to them within your command prompt/terminal. 
Type <b>npm install</b> and wait for all packages to install. 
Once they do run <b>node .</b> this will start up the bot. What you need to do now is navigate in a web browser to <b>http://localhost:8080</b>. 
Then click <b>Get Started!</b> the channel ID is of the streamer account. 
The other details are for the <b>BOT ACCOUNT (SO MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOGGED INTO IT)</b> can be found by going to https://youtube.com, opening inspect element (ctrl + shift + i). Then type <b>document.cookie</b> (MAKE SURE NOT TO SHARE THIS COOKIES). From here simply sort through so you only have the ones you need. Make sure to remove the quotes around them and semi-colons if there are any. After this submit it. From here, you need to do two things from the dashboard. 1. Click <b>Refresh Stream</b> to get your current live. And also enabled the bot (at the top of the page). From here the bot is yours to customize!
