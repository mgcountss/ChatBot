### This is the same chatbot I use in my 24/7 <a href="https://youtube.com/@sfmg/live">live stream</a>!

## How To Setup!
To run the program, make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. I use v18.20.1 but any version above 14 should work.
1. Clone the repository by running `git clone https://github.com/mgcountss/ChatBot`
2. Open the folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. Run the program by typing `node index.js` in the terminal.
4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` then click on `Get Started`.
5. Enter in the streaming account's youtube channel id (ex. `https://youtube.com/channel/{channel_id}`), only enter the channel id though.
6. Enter in the chatbot's youtube channel id (ex. `https://youtube.com/channel/{channel_id}`), only enter the channel id though.
7. Click "Start", an Electron popup window should appear prompting you to login to your google account.
8. Login to the **BOT ACCOUNT** and once you see the YouTube home page, close the window.
9. The bot should now be running now and if it's not try clicking the "Refresh Stream!" button.
10. If you have any issues, please join the <a href="https://discord.gg/v2PdpBk3Gm">discord</a> and ask for help.
